<p>As I mentioned in my last In Correspondence, I’m starting a&nbsp;<strong>monthly news review</strong>&nbsp;videocall for paying subscribers of this newsletter, where I’ll offer deeper commentary and analysis on content I’ve shared to my&nbsp;<a href="https://stephenreid.net/knowledgegraph">knowledgegraph</a>&nbsp;and other items mentioned here.</p><p>The first call will take place tonight<strong> </strong>from 6pm-7pm UK time, with a link sent to paying subscribers, and a recording sent afterwards.</p><p></p><p>The investment I’m asking for is $10/month (or $100/year), with the option of a $300/year Founding Member plan if you particularly appreciate my work and would like the option of being featured in this newsletter.</p><p>Your support would mean a lot to me, and will enable me to keep seeking out and connecting quality content in these strange times.</p>
