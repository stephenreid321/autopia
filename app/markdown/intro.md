10,000 AUT (Autopia Tokens, currency symbol <span class="zt">A</span>) were minted as an ERC-20 on the Ethereum mainnet. These tokens were then be transferred to the xDai chain (where transactions cost just cents rather than dollars) using the xDai OmniBridge.

**51% of the tokens were airdropped to subscribers of the [Stephen Reid In Correspondence](http://stephenreid.substack.com/) newsletter who registered by 11.59pm on Winter Solstice, 21st December 2020**, in proportion to the number of links clicked in past newsletters (people registering who had never clicked a link were included as if they had clicked one link).

Over 12 new moons ~25% of the total supply will be put into a liquidity pool on Honeyswap at an initial ratio of 1 AUT : 1 xDAI:

<strong>The top 150 AUT holders will be invited to a new, private Autopia Slack.</strong> Each new moon, anyone who has become a top 150 AUT holder will be added to the Slack, and anyone who is no longer a top 150 AUT holder will be removed. On the Autopia Slack, discussions will begin around a real-life co-created gathering in Summer 2021. It will also become the main place I share timely and important news and tips from the crypto world and beyond.

* If you are a top 150 AUT holder, expect an invite to the Slack.
* If you aren't a top 150 AUT holder, but would like to join the Slack, you can buy more AUT on Honeyswap â€” or ask someone to gift some to you.
* If you're not interested in being part of the Autopia community, you are welcome to sell your AUT on Honeyswap and make a few DAI.
