Dear friends,

I am reviving the Autopia name/brand for a cryptoeconomic experiment in community and co-creation.

10,000 AUT (Autopia Tokens) will be minted as an ERC-20 on the Ethereum mainnet. These tokens will then be transferred to the xDai chain (where transactions cost just cents rather than dollars) using the xDai OmniBridge.

51% of the tokens will be airdropped to subscribers of the [Stephen Reid In Correspondence](http://stephenreid.substack.com/) newsletter who [register via this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUnLxvkMhjsV8TsV_meH2gHdleT2HrRQL_SlVFkHxGfFKdoA/viewform?usp=sf_link), in proportion to the number of links clicked in my past newsletters (people registering who have never clicked a link will be included as if they had clicked one link). I will hold the other 49%, and place half of this amount (so ~25% of the total supply) into a liquidity pool on Honeyswap at an initial ratio of 1 AUT : 1 xDAI (i.e. initially, 1 AUT will be worth $1 â€“ this involves me putting $2500 of my own money at risk).

(Edit: If it seems demand for AUT is likely to be high, I may release the 25% reserved for liquidity provision over time rather than making it available in one go. Either way the initial ratio will be 1 AUT : 1 xDAI.)

The top 150 AUT holders will be invited to a new, private Autopia Slack. Each new moon, anyone who has become a top 150 AUT holder will be invited to the Slack, and anyone who is no longer a top 150 AUT holder will be removed. On the Autopia Slack, discussions will begin around a real-life co-created gathering in Summer 2021. It will also become the main place I share timely and important news and tips from the crypto world and beyond.

So, after the airdrop:

* If you are a top 150 AUT holder, expect an invite to the Slack.
* If you aren't a top 150 AUT holder, but would like to join the Slack, you can buy more AUT on Honeyswap (edit: or ask someone to gift some to you).
* If you're not interested in being part of the Autopia community, you are welcome to sell your AUT on Honeyswap and make a few DAI.

With curiosity,<br />
Stephen
