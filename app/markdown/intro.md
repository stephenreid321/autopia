10,000 AUT (Autopia Tokens) will be minted as an ERC-20 on the Ethereum mainnet. These tokens will then be transferred to the xDai chain (where transactions cost just cents rather than dollars) using the xDai OmniBridge.

**51% of the tokens will be airdropped to subscribers of the [Stephen Reid In Correspondence](http://stephenreid.substack.com/) newsletter who [register via this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUnLxvkMhjsV8TsV_meH2gHdleT2HrRQL_SlVFkHxGfFKdoA/viewform) by 11.59pm on Winter Solstice, 22nd December 2020**, in proportion to the number of links clicked in past newsletters (people registering who have never clicked a link will be included as if they had clicked one link).

I will hold the other 49%, and over 12 months place ~half of this amount (so ~25% of the total supply) into a liquidity pool on Honeyswap at an initial ratio of 1 AUT : 1 xDAI:

<strong>The top 150 AUT holders will be invited to a new, private Autopia Slack.</strong> Each new moon, anyone who has become a top 150 AUT holder will be invited to the Slack, and anyone who is no longer a top 150 AUT holder will be removed. On the Autopia Slack, discussions will begin around a real-life co-created gathering in Summer 2021. It will also become the main place I share timely and important news and tips from the crypto world and beyond.

So, after the airdrop:

* If you are a top 150 AUT holder, expect an invite to the Slack.
* If you aren't a top 150 AUT holder, but would like to join the Slack, you can buy more AUT on Honeyswap â€” or ask someone to gift some to you.
* If you're not interested in being part of the Autopia community, you are welcome to sell your AUT on Honeyswap and make a few DAI.

With curiosity,<br />
